# MillenniumOS (MOS) - An "Operations System" for RepRapFirmware

Cheap and easy manual and automatic work-piece probing, toolchanges and toolsetting and more!

This is an "operations system" rather than an "operating system" in the traditional sense.

We build _on top of_ RepRapFirmware, providing operators of the Millennium Machines Milo V1.5 with a new-machinist-friendly workflow for work piece and tool probing, and safe, effective tool changes.

## Features

- Canned probing cycles usable directly from gcode or via Duet Web Control as named macros.
- Fallbacks to guided manual probing when touch probe and / or toolsetter is not available.
- Safety checks at every step to instill confidence in novice machinists.
- Variable Spindle Speed Control.
- Compatible with Millennium Machines Milo GCode Dialect.

## Usage

Please follow the installation instructions on our [documentation](https://millenniummachines.github.io/docs/millennium-os/) site.

If you have not already installed a supported RRF configuration, then you should follow the instructions for the [Milo](https://millenniummachines.github.io/docs/milo/).

If you are not using a Millennium Machine, you will need to create a compatible configuration yourself.

## Liability

You are fully responsible for running the code contained in this library on your own machine. It has been tested on a number of different machines by different people, and is written from a safety-first perspective, but it is a fool who thinks that they can write software without bugs, and it is a (somewhat lesser) fool to _use_ that software and not expect occasional shenanigans. These shenanigans might cost you money in the best case, and blood in the worst - and by using this software you agree that we are not liable for any losses that might occur to you or others during your use of the software.

It is up to you, and only you, to take the relevant precautions when using MillenniumOS - run your tool paths without a workpiece installed and spindle disabled, test the probing routines with soft(er) items (e.g. a roll of tape for bore probe, a cardboard box for block or corner probes), stay away from the machine when it is moving and ___ALWAYS WEAR EYE PROTECTION___!

Remember that this is designed for machines that can really hurt you if you're not careful. This software tries its best to protect you but nothing can stand in the way of a really determined idiot :sweat_smile:

## Bugs, Issues, Support

If you find any bugs or issues, please create an issue on this repository. Best-effort support is available via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ya4UUj7ax2).

## Information for Advanced users and Developers

The information contained here is for advanced users who want to understand further how MillenniumOS works, and what it is capable of. For normal usage, all the information you need is in the [documentation](https://millenniummachines.github.io/docs/millennium-os/manual/installation/).

### Notes

- You _must_ be using RRF `v3.5.0-rc.3` or above. MOS uses many 'meta gcode' features that do not exist in earlier versions.
- MOS includes its own `daemon.g` file to implement repetitive tasks, such as VSSC. If you want to implement your own repetitive tasks, you should create a `user-daemon.g` file in the `/sys` directory, which MillenniumOS will run during its' own daemon loop. Disabling the MOS daemon tasks will also disable any `user-daemon.g` tasks. Do not use any long-running loops inside `user-daemon.g` as this will interfere with MOS's own daemon behaviour.

### RRF Config

You need a working RRF config with all of your machine axes moving in the right direction before you start.

If you can't home your machine, make that work first - following the MillenniumOS configuration wizard will be impossible without a machine that moves correctly.

You need to configure your Toolsetter and optionally, Touch Probe, in RRF before trying to use them in MillenniumOS.

This involves configuring both of them as Z probes, which can be done with the `M558` command.

You would add line(s) similar to these to your RRF `config.g` file, above where the MillenniumOS file (`mos.g`) is included.

```gcode

; Configure the touch probe as Z-Probe 0 on pin "probe" - mainboard specific, DO NOT COPY AND PASTE!
; Type P5             = filtered digital
; Dive Height H2      = back-off 2mm before repeat probing
; Max Retries A10     = retry probe a maximum of 10 times
; Tolerance S0.01     = when tolerance is reached, stop probing
; Travel Speed T1200  = travel moves run at this speed to the start of the probing location
; Probe Speed F300:50 = initial probe speed runs at 300mm/min, subsequent at 50mm/min
M558 K0 P5 C"probe" H2 A10 S0.01 T1200 F300:50

; Configure the toolsetter as Z-Probe 1 on pin "xstopmax" - mainboard specific, DO NOT COPY AND PASTE!
; Type P8             = unfiltered digital
; Dive Height H10     = back-off 10mm before repeat probing
; Max Retries A10     = retry probe a maximum of 10 times
; Tolerance S0.01     = when tolerance is reached, stop probing
; Travel Speed T1200  = travel moves run at this speed to the start of the probing location
; Probe Speed F300:60 = initial probe speed runs at 300mm/min, subsequent at 60mm/min
M558 K1 P8 C"xstopmax" H10 A10 S0.01 T1200 F300:60

```

#### Tool Definition

You will also want to remove any manual tool definitions from your configuration, as MillenniumOS manages tools through the `M4000` and `M4001` custom M-codes - remove any lines in your `config.g` that use the `M563` command, and also any lines which refer to tools which would have been created by these commands (e.g. `G10 P<toolnumber>`).

#### Touch Probe Type Configuration

Some touch probes may not filter their outputs, which means they can be subject to bouncing. This is where, when the switch or detection mechanism inside the touch probe changes state, it flaps between the two states before settling into its' final position. This can cause issues in MillenniumOS with protected moves, as we stop moving when the probe is activated or deactivated but by the time we check the probe status, it might have flipped.

The solution for this is to define the touch probe as ID _Zero_ and the probe type as 5 (`M558 K0 P5 C"probe"...`), as in the above example configuration line. This enables filtering in RRF which debounces the probe input. The downside of this is that the probe may respond more slowly, but this is not necessarily a problem as the delay is likely to be accounted for in the deflection values calculated for X and Y. It is also not possible to define more than one probe as type 5, so if you already have a probe that requires type 5 that is _not_ your touch probe then this may be an issue.

Your touch probe may not need filtering, and you can test this by moving it to a different probe ID (2, for example) and changing the type to 8 like the toolsetter definition.

### Warnings and Known Issues

Due to some issues with RRF as it currently stands, there are a small number of situations where you can shoot yourself in the foot when running MillenniumOS macros outside of a print file. These are:

- Clicking Cancel on a messagebox to abort a probing routine may trigger undesired behaviour when running a probe **outside** of a print file. This is because clicking cancel on a message box, if outside of a print, simply returns from the macro that created the box. There is no way to easily detect this from any calling macros so we could end up running moves that were unexpected. This is something that ideally will need to be fixed by the RRF devs and is documented [here](https://forum.duet3d.com/topic/34945/meta-gcode-result-variable-inconsistent-with-docs?_=1707734672834). When clicking cancel from _within_ a print, the whole print is aborted from that point so this behaviour should not be an issue when executing actual CAM code produced by our post-processor.

- Toolchanges cannot currently be cancelled, so if a touch probe is not detected during the touch probe installation routine, then the active tool number will still be set to the probing tool. This will not affect print files because an aborted toolchange aborts the print (but still sets the active tool number). We use the tool number as a guard to not execute probing routines unless the touch probe is installed, so this leaves some window of vulnerability where it could _appear_ like a touch probe is connected when it actually wasn't detected. Again, this is likely something that should be fixed in RRF but if we absolutely _have_ to work around it by tracking touchprobe connectivity ourselves then we can implement this.

- If the touch probe is activated during a protected move, then due to how this is implemented in RRF it is _possible_ that the speeds of the probe were not reset correctly. Subsequent probes will run at the same speed which might be very slow, or very fast (if the interrupted move was a travel move). You should be aware of this when restarting from a collision during a protected move. We are currently looking for options as to how to improve this behaviour, but it may involve underlying changes to RRF to allow this.

- Memory limits on the `stm32f4` chip are very restrictive - MOS uses quite a lot of global variables for communication between macros and configuration, and is pushing the limits of this chip. You may receive `OutOfMemory` crashes (check `M122` after an unexpected reboot to confirm) if you use global variables in other places in your configuration. The only way around this issue at the moment is to reduce the number and size of global variables in other locations - MillenniumOS is already about as efficient as it can be.

#### Troubleshooting

To help us work out any issues, please run `M7600 D1` and paste the whole output into any issue you create, or attach with any help request in Discord. This output includes the value of MOS specific variables and also the contents of the RRF object model - specifically the limits, move, sensors, spindles, state and tool keys which are essential for debugging MillenniumOS functionality (or lack thereof).
