# Machine Macros

These macros perform machine operations that do not involve any movement of the machine itself. They usually configure settings or similar.

All macros in this directory should be `M` codes.

You _must not_ put macros that cause any movement of the machine in this directory.

These files are moved to `/sys` on release so that they can be triggered by RRF using their code.
