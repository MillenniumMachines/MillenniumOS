; M5.9.g: SPINDLE OFF
;
; It takes a bit of time to decelerate the spindle. How long this
; requires depends on the VFD setup and how much energy can be
; dissipated. A short deceleration time can be achieved through the
; use of a suitable braking resistor connected to the VFD. The spindle
; needs to be controlled by both the firmware (for pause / resume
; amongst other things) and the post-processor, so we need an m-code
; that can be used by both and that means our wait-for-spindle dwell
; time only needs to exist in one place.

; all spindles if no tool is selected. To avoid having to wait the
; deceleration time if no spindles are actually running, we check
; for this first and only trigger a wait if any spindles are
; activated.
