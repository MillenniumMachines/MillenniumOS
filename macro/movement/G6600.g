; G6600.g: PROBE WORK PIECE
;
; Meta macro to prompt the user to probe a work piece.
; Takes a single optional parameter, W<work-offset> and guides
; the user through the process of probing the work piece.
; If the W parameter is specified, the work offset origin will
; be set to the probed location.

; 1. Prompt the user for the type of probing operation they need
; 2. Run the meta macro for the selected probing operation, which will
;    prompt the user for the probe parameters. The meta macro will then
;    call the appropriate probing macro.

; Make sure this file is not executed by the secondary motion system

; This is just for safety. It is good practice to park the machine and
; stop the spindle before calling any probing macro, and we should do
; this in any post-processor that targets the MillenniumOS Gcode Dialect,
; but we do this here just to make 100% certain that nobody is going to
; end up jogging the spindle around while it is running.
