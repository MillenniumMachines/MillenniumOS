; Called before the tool change to trigger guidance
; to the operator.

; that has access to both the current and 'new'
; tool information. It is called automatically when
; executing T<n> without any additional parameters
; to block tool change macros.

; then we can continue.
; We also allow running if tpre did not run to completion last time, as a
; subsequent successful tool change will bring the machine back to a consistent
